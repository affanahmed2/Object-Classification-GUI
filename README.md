# 📖 Object Classification GUI

## 1️⃣ Project Overview
This project is a GUI-based object classification tool that uses OpenCV and PyQt5. It enables users to load images, extract histogram-based features, and train a classification model. The key objectives include:
- Providing a user-friendly interface for image classification.
- Extracting color histograms in HSV format for feature representation.
- Supporting dataset training and classification tasks.
